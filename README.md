# OS-Page-Replacement-and-Scheduling-Algorithms

* Developed a simulation framework that generates synthetic page‑reference streams based on RAM capacity and process count.
* Evaluated OPT, FIFO, LRU, and MRU page‑replacement algorithms across all feasible page‑sizes, reporting comprehensive hit‑rate comparisons.
* Employed object‑oriented design to create modular, extensible, and loosely coupled classes, adhering to industry‑level coding standards.
* Incorporated system‑design patterns—such as the Singleton—to streamline architecture and ensure efficient state management.
